This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was a code along with a udemy course, using the movie database api to pull back data on a particular movie or popular 'trending' ones. It saves state in local storage to limit the number of API calls needed, which greatly speeds up any re-renders of the home page.

The project is live on [Heroku here] (https://young-spire-34876.herokuapp.com/).
